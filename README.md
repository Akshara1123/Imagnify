Detailed Explanation of Image Processing Capabilities
Image Restoration
Image restoration is the process of repairing and enhancing old, damaged, or degraded images to their original quality. This involves removing scratches, blemishes, and noise, and correcting color and brightness levels. The AI algorithms analyze the damaged areas and intelligently fill in the gaps, ensuring that the restored image maintains a natural look.

Image Recoloring
Image recoloring involves changing the colors of objects within an image. This feature allows users to alter the color palette of an image to suit specific aesthetic preferences or to highlight certain elements. The AI model identifies distinct objects and applies the desired colors while preserving shadows and textures, resulting in a realistic and visually pleasing transformation.

Generative Fill
Generative fill is a technique used to fill in missing or damaged parts of an image seamlessly. The AI model analyzes the surrounding areas and generates content that blends perfectly with the existing image. This is particularly useful for filling holes, extending backgrounds, or reconstructing parts of an image that were previously removed.

Object Removal
Object removal allows users to eliminate unwanted elements from their images. The AI identifies and isolates the object to be removed and then reconstructs the background to fill the gap. This process ensures that the edited image appears natural, with no traces of the removed object.

Background Removal
Background removal involves isolating the main subject of an image and removing the background entirely. This feature is useful for creating transparent backgrounds, which can be used for product images, graphic design, and other applications. The AI accurately detects the edges of the subject and separates it from the background, maintaining sharpness and detail.

Payments and Credit System
The platform incorporates a robust payments and credit system to ensure seamless user transactions. Users can earn or purchase credits that are required for accessing various image transformation features. The integration with Stripe provides a secure and efficient payment gateway for purchasing credits. This system not only ensures uninterrupted usage of the platform's capabilities but also supports flexible credit management through user profiles, where users can track their credit balance, transaction history, and easily top up credits as needed. This model fosters a sustainable revenue stream while offering users a convenient and secure way to utilize the platform's advanced features.
